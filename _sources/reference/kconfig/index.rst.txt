Configuration Options
=====================

:file:`Kconfig` files describe build-time configuration options (called symbols
in Kconfig-speak), how they're grouped into menus and sub-menus, and
dependencies between them that determine what configurations are valid.

:file:`Kconfig` files appear throughout the directory tree. For example,
:file:`subsys/power/Kconfig` defines power-related options.

This documentation is generated automatically from the :file:`Kconfig` files by
the :file:`gen_kconfig_rest.py` script. Click on symbols for more
information.

This index page lists all symbols, regardless of where they are defined:
