Description
***********

These nodes are "i2c" bus nodes.

.. code-block:: none

   Atmel SAM4L Family I2C (TWIM) node

   The Atmel Two-wire Master Interface (TWIM) interconnects components on a
   unique two-wire bus, made up of one clock line and one data line with speeds
   of up to 3.4 Mbit/s, based on a byte-oriented transfer format.  The TWIM is
   always a bus master and can transfer sequential or single bytes.  Multiple
   master capability is supported.  Arbitration of the bus is performed
   internally and relinquishes the bus automatically if the bus arbitration is
   lost.

   When using speeds above standard mode, user may need adjust clock and data
   lines slew and strength parameters.  In general, slew 0 and minimal strength
   is enougth for short buses and light loads.  As reference, the below
   is the lowest power configuration:

     std-clk-slew-lim = <0>;
     std-clk-strength-low = "0.5";
     std-data-slew-lim = <0>;
     std-data-strength-low = "0.5";

     hs-clk-slew-lim = <0>;
     hs-clk-strength-high = "0.5";
     hs-clk-strength-low = "0.5";
     hs-data-slew-lim = <0>;
     hs-data-strength-low = "0.5";

   For best performances, user can tune the slope curves using an osciloscope.
   The tuning should be performed by groups defined <mode>-<line>.  The prefix
   std-<line> configures fast/fast-plus mode speeds and hs-<line> selects the
   high speed mode.  The tune should be performed for both clock and data lines
   on both speed modes.
