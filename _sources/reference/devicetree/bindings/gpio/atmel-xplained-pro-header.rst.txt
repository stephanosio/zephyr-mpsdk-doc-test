Description
***********



.. code-block:: none

   GPIO pins exposed on Atmel Xplained Pro headers.

   The Xplained Pro layout provide a standard 20 pin header.  A board can have
   one or more headers and can share pins.  The extension headers are given
   names EXTn where n ϵ [1…7], n is determined by which ID pin is connected
   to the embedded debugger.  A header with ID7 signal from the embedded
   debugger connected should be called EXT7. PWR, EXT1, EXT2 and EXT3 are
   standard extension headers that have a predefined position according to the
   list below:
     * PWR is right angled at the top right hand side of the board. This
     header must always be implemented.
     * EXT1 is right angled at the top right hand side of the board, located
     below the PWR header. This header must always be present.
     * EXT2 is right angled and at the bottom right hand side of the board.
     This header is mandatory for medium and large boards and should not be
     implemented on small boards.
     * EXT3 is right angled pointing downwards
   All MCU boards have to implement at least PWR, EXT1, EXT2 (on medium and
   large boards), and EXT3. EXT4 to EXT7 can be placed differently depending
   on the board design. EXT4 to EXT7 can either be standard extension headers
   or application specific headers.

   This binding provides a nexus mapping for 20 pins where pins are disposed
   to have a even and odd column:

                Wake up capable devices are disabled (interruptions will not wake up
                the system) by default but they can be enabled at runtime if necessary.
