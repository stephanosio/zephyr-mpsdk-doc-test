   PWM LEDs parent node

Properties
**********

Top level properties
====================


These property descriptions apply to "pwm-leds"
nodes themselves. This page also describes child node
properties in the following sections.

.. tabs::

   .. group-tab:: Node specific properties

      Properties not inherited from the base binding file.

      (None)

   .. group-tab:: Deprecated node specific properties

      Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

      (None)

   .. group-tab:: Base properties

      Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
      common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
      may apply to the "pwm-leds" compatible.

      .. list-table::
         :widths: 1 1 4
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Name
           - Type
           - Details

         * - ``label``
           - ``string``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Human readable string describing the device and used to set the device
                name. It can be passed as argument to device_get_binding() to retrieve
                the device. If this property is omitted, then the device name is set
                from the node full name.



             See :ref:`dt-important-props` for more information.




Child node properties
=====================

.. list-table::
   :widths: 1 1 4
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Name
     - Type
     - Details

   * - ``pwms``
     - ``phandle-array``
     - This property is **required**.

   * - ``label``
     - ``string``
     - .. code-block:: none

          Human readable string describing the LED. It can be used by an
          application to identify this LED or to retrieve its number/index
          (i.e. child node number) on the parent device.



       See :ref:`dt-important-props` for more information.
