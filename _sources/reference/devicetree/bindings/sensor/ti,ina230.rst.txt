Description
***********



.. code-block:: none

   TI INA230 and INA231 Bidirectional Current and Power Monitor.
   The <include/dt-bindings/sensor/ina230.h> file should be included
   in the DeviceTree and it provides macro that can be used for
   initializing the configuration register.

      .. list-table::
         :widths: 1 1 4
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Name
           - Type
           - Details

         * - ``mask``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Mask register, default matches the power-on reset value


         * - ``alert-limit``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Alert register, default matches the power-on reset value


         * - ``irq-gpios``
           - ``phandle-array``
           - .. code-block:: none

                IRQ Alert pin


         * - ``config``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Value of the configuration register
                e.g shunt voltage and bus voltage ADC conversion
                times and averaging, operating mode for INA230 or
                delay for initial ADC conversion, shunt full scale range
                for INA237.



             This property is **required**.

         * - ``current-lsb``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Value of Current LSB in milliamps. When set to 1mA,
                Current is read in A, Bus Voltage in V, Shunt
                Voltage in V, and Power in mW. Any other value
                results in Current, Voltage, and Power registers
                being read in counts.



             This property is **required**.

         * - ``rshunt``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Shunt resistor value in milliohms


             This property is **required**.

         * - ``supply-gpios``
           - ``phandle-array``
           - .. code-block:: none

                GPIO specifier that controls power to the device.

                This property should be provided when the device has a dedicated
                switch that controls power to the device.  The supply state is
                entirely the responsibility of the device driver.

                Contrast with vin-supply.



         * - ``vin-supply``
           - ``phandle``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Reference to the regulator that controls power to the device.
                The referenced devicetree node must have a regulator compatible.

                This property should be provided when device power is supplied
                by a shared regulator.  The supply state is dependent on the
                request status of all devices fed by the regulator.

                Contrast with supply-gpios.  If both properties are provided
                then the regulator must be requested before the supply GPIOS is
                set to an active state, and the supply GPIOS must be set to an
                inactive state before releasing the regulator.





   .. group-tab:: Deprecated node specific properties

      Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

      (None)

   .. group-tab:: Base properties

      Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
      common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
      may apply to the "ti,ina230" compatible.
