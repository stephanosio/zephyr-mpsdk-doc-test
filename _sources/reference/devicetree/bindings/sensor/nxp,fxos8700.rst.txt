           - .. code-block:: none

                RST pin
                This pin defaults to active high when consumed by the sensor.
                The property value should ensure the flags properly describe
                the signal that is presented to the driver.

           - ``phandle-array``
           - .. code-block:: none

                INT1 pin
                This pin defaults to active low when produced by the sensor.
                The property value should ensure the flags properly describe
                the signal that is presented to the driver.

                This pin defaults to active low when produced by the sensor.
                The property value should ensure the flags properly describe
                the signal that is presented to the driver.

         * - ``power-mode``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Power mode


             Legal values: ``0``, ``1``, ``2``, ``3``

         * - ``pulse-cfg``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Pulse configuration register


             Default value: ``63``

         * - ``pulse-thsx``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Pulse X-axis threshold
                Threshold to start the pulse-event detection procedure on the X-axis.
                Threshold values for each axis are unsigned 7-bit numbers with a fixed
                resolution of 0.063 g/LSB, corresponding to an 8g acceleration
                full-scale range.



             Default value: ``32``

         * - ``pulse-thsy``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Pulse Y-axis threshold
                Threshold to start the pulse-event detection procedure on the Y-axis.
                Threshold values for each axis are unsigned 7-bit numbers with a fixed
                resolution of 0.063 g/LSB, corresponding to an 8g acceleration
                full-scale range.



             Default value: ``32``

         * - ``pulse-thsz``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Pulse Z-axis threshold
                Threshold to start the pulse-event detection procedure on the Z-axis.
                Threshold values for each axis are unsigned 7-bit numbers with a fixed
                resolution of 0.063 g/LSB, corresponding to an 8g acceleration
                full-scale range.



             Default value: ``64``

         * - ``pulse-tmlt``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Pulse time limit
                The maximum time interval that can elapse between the start of the
                acceleration on the selected channel exceeding the specified threshold
                and the end when the channel acceleration goes back below the specified
                threshold. The resolution depends upon the sample rate (ODR) and the
                high-pass filter configuration (HP_FILTER_CUTOFF[pls_hpf_en]). For
                ODR=800 Hz and pls_hpf_en=0, the resolution is 0.625 ms/LSB.



             Default value: ``24``

         * - ``pulse-ltcy``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Pulse latency
                The time interval that starts after the first pulse detection where the
                pulse-detection function ignores the start of a new pulse. The
                resolution depends upon the sample rate (ODR) and the high-pass filter
                configuration (HP_FILTER_CUTOFF[pls_hpf_en]). For ODR=800 Hz and
                pls_hpf_en=0, the resolution is 1.25 ms/LSB.



             Default value: ``40``

         * - ``pulse-wind``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Pulse window
                The maximum interval of time that can elapse after the end of the
                latency interval in which the start of the second pulse event must be
                detected provided the device has been configured for double pulse
                detection. The detected second pulse width must be shorter than the
                time limit constraint specified by the PULSE_TMLT register, but the end
                of the double pulse need not finish within the time specified by the
                PULSE_WIND register. The resolution depends upon the sample rate (ODR)
                and the high-pass filter configuration (HP_FILTER_CUTOFF[pls_hpf_en]).
                For ODR=800 Hz and pls_hpf_en=0, the resolution is 1.25 ms/LSB.



             Default value: ``60``

         * - ``mag-vecm-cfg``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Magnetic vector-magnitude configuration register


             Default value: ``78``

         * - ``mag-vecm-ths-msb``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Magnetic vector-magnitude threshold most significant byte.
                Resolution is 0.1 uT/LSB.



         * - ``mag-vecm-ths-lsb``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Magnetic vector-magnitude threshold least significant byte.
                Resolution is 0.1 uT/LSB.



             Default value: ``90``

         * - ``supply-gpios``
           - ``phandle-array``
           - .. code-block:: none

                GPIO specifier that controls power to the device.

                This property should be provided when the device has a dedicated
                switch that controls power to the device.  The supply state is
                entirely the responsibility of the device driver.

                Contrast with vin-supply.



         * - ``vin-supply``
           - ``phandle``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Reference to the regulator that controls power to the device.
                The referenced devicetree node must have a regulator compatible.

                This property should be provided when device power is supplied
                by a shared regulator.  The supply state is dependent on the
                request status of all devices fed by the regulator.

                Contrast with supply-gpios.  If both properties are provided
                then the regulator must be requested before the supply GPIOS is
                set to an active state, and the supply GPIOS must be set to an
                inactive state before releasing the regulator.
