      .. list-table::
         :widths: 1 1 4
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Name
           - Type
           - Details

         * - ``spi-max-frequency``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Maximum clock frequency of device's SPI interface in Hz


             This property is **required**.

         * - ``duplex``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Duplex mode, full or half. By default it's always full duplex thus 0
                as this is, by far, the most common mode.
                Use the macros not the actual enum value, here is the concordance
                list (see dt-bindings/spi/spi.h)
                  0    SPI_FULL_DUPLEX
                  2048 SPI_HALF_DUPLEX



             Legal values: ``0``, ``2048``

         * - ``frame-format``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Motorola or TI frame format. By default it's always Motorola's,
                thus 0 as this is, by far, the most common format.
                Use the macros not the actual enum value, here is the concordance
                list (see dt-bindings/spi/spi.h)
                  0     SPI_FRAME_FORMAT_MOTOROLA
                  32768 SPI_FRAME_FORMAT_TI



             Legal values: ``0``, ``32768``

         * - ``supply-gpios``
           - ``phandle-array``
           - .. code-block:: none

                GPIO specifier that controls power to the device.

                This property should be provided when the device has a dedicated
                switch that controls power to the device.  The supply state is
                entirely the responsibility of the device driver.

                Contrast with vin-supply.



         * - ``vin-supply``
           - ``phandle``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Reference to the regulator that controls power to the device.
                The referenced devicetree node must have a regulator compatible.

                This property should be provided when device power is supplied
                by a shared regulator.  The supply state is dependent on the
                request status of all devices fed by the regulator.

                Contrast with supply-gpios.  If both properties are provided
                then the regulator must be requested before the supply GPIOS is
                set to an active state, and the supply GPIOS must be set to an
                inactive state before releasing the regulator.



         * - ``irq-gpios``
           - ``phandle-array``
           - .. code-block:: none

                The INT1 and (optional) INT2 signal connections.  These signals
                are active-high as produced by the sensor.



         * - ``disconnect-sdo-sa0-pull-up``
           - ``boolean``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Indicates the device driver should disconnect SDO/SA0 pull-up
                during device initialization (e.g. to save current
                leakage). Note that only subset of devices supported by this
                binding have SDO/SA0 pull-up (e.g. LIS2DH12, LIS3DH).





   .. group-tab:: Deprecated node specific properties

      Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

      (None)

   .. group-tab:: Base properties

      Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
      common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these

                the system) by default but they can be enabled at runtime if necessary.
