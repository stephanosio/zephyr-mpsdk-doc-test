      .. list-table::
         :widths: 1 1 4
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Name
           - Type
           - Details

         * - ``spi-max-frequency``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Maximum clock frequency of device's SPI interface in Hz


             This property is **required**.

         * - ``duplex``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Duplex mode, full or half. By default it's always full duplex thus 0
                as this is, by far, the most common mode.
                Use the macros not the actual enum value, here is the concordance
                list (see dt-bindings/spi/spi.h)
                  0    SPI_FULL_DUPLEX
                  2048 SPI_HALF_DUPLEX



             Legal values: ``0``, ``2048``

         * - ``frame-format``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Motorola or TI frame format. By default it's always Motorola's,
                thus 0 as this is, by far, the most common format.
                Use the macros not the actual enum value, here is the concordance
                list (see dt-bindings/spi/spi.h)
                  0     SPI_FRAME_FORMAT_MOTOROLA
                  32768 SPI_FRAME_FORMAT_TI



             Legal values: ``0``, ``32768``

         * - ``supply-gpios``
           - ``phandle-array``
           - .. code-block:: none

                GPIO specifier that controls power to the device.

                This property should be provided when the device has a dedicated
                switch that controls power to the device.  The supply state is
                entirely the responsibility of the device driver.

                Contrast with vin-supply.



         * - ``vin-supply``
           - ``phandle``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Reference to the regulator that controls power to the device.
                The referenced devicetree node must have a regulator compatible.

                This property should be provided when device power is supplied
                by a shared regulator.  The supply state is dependent on the
                request status of all devices fed by the regulator.

                Contrast with supply-gpios.  If both properties are provided
                then the regulator must be requested before the supply GPIOS is
                set to an active state, and the supply GPIOS must be set to an
                inactive state before releasing the regulator.



         * - ``drdy-gpios``
           - ``phandle-array``
           - .. code-block:: none

                DRDY pin

                This pin defaults to active high when produced by the sensor.
                The property value should ensure the flags properly describe
                the signal that is presented to the driver.



         * - ``drdy-int``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Select DRDY pin number (1 or 2).
                This number represents which of the two interrupt pins (INT1 or INT2) the drdy line is attached to. This property is not mandatory and if not present it defaults to 1 which is the configuration at power-up.


             Default value: ``1``

             Legal values: ``1``, ``2``

         * - ``range``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Range in g. Default is power-up configuration.


             Default value: ``2``

             Legal values: ``16``, ``8``, ``4``, ``2``

         * - ``power-mode``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Specify the sensor power mode. Default is power-up configuration.


             Legal values: ``0``, ``1``, ``2``, ``3``, ``4``

         * - ``tap-mode``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Tap mode. Default is power-up configuration.


             Legal values: ``0``, ``1``

         * - ``tap-threshold``
           - ``array``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Tap X/Y/Z axes threshold. Default is power-up configuration.
                (X/Y/Z values range from 0x00 to 0x1F)

                Thresholds to start the tap-event detection procedure on the X/Y/Z axes.
                Threshold values for each axis are unsigned 5-bit corresponding
                to a 2g acceleration full-scale range. A threshold value equal to zero
                corresponds to disable the tap detection on that axis.

                For example, if you want to set the threshold for X to 12, for Z to 14
                and want to disable tap detection on Y, you should specify in Device Tree

                    tap-threshold = <12>, <0>, <14>

                which is equivalent to X = 12 * 2g/32 = 750mg and Z = 14 * 2g/32 = 875mg.



             Default value: ``[0, 0, 0]``

         * - ``tap-shock``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Tap shock value. Default is power-up configuration.
                (values range from 0x0 to 0x3)
                This register represents the maximum time of an over-threshold signal
                detection to be recognized as a tap event. Where 0 equals 4*1/ODR and
                1LSB = 8*1/ODR.



         * - ``tap-latency``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Tap latency. Default is power-up configuration.
                (values range from 0x0 to 0xF)
                When double-tap recognition is enabled, this register expresses the
                maximum time between two successive detected taps to determine a
                double-tap event. Where 0 equals 16*1/ODR and 1LSB = 32*1/ODR.



         * - ``tap-quiet``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Expected quiet time after a tap detection. Default is power-up configuration.
                (values range from 0x0 to 0x3)
                This register represents the time after the first detected tap in which
                there must not be any overthreshold event. Where 0 equals 2*1/ODR
                and 1LSB = 4*1/ODR.
