         * - Name
           - Type
           - Details

         * - ``supply-gpios``
           - ``phandle-array``
           - .. code-block:: none

                GPIO specifier that controls power to the device.

                This property should be provided when the device has a dedicated
                switch that controls power to the device.  The supply state is
                entirely the responsibility of the device driver.

                Contrast with vin-supply.



         * - ``vin-supply``
           - ``phandle``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Reference to the regulator that controls power to the device.
                The referenced devicetree node must have a regulator compatible.

                This property should be provided when device power is supplied
                by a shared regulator.  The supply state is dependent on the
                request status of all devices fed by the regulator.

                Contrast with supply-gpios.  If both properties are provided
                then the regulator must be requested before the supply GPIOS is
                set to an active state, and the supply GPIOS must be set to an
                inactive state before releasing the regulator.



         * - ``irq-gpios``
           - ``phandle-array``
           - .. code-block:: none

                IRQ pin
                This pin defaults to active high when produced by the sensor. The property value should ensure the flags properly describe the signal that is presented to the driver.


         * - ``single-mode``
           - ``boolean``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Set to config the sensor in single measurement mode. Leave
                unset to configure the sensor in continious measurement mode.



         * - ``cancel-offset``
           - ``boolean``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Set to enable the offset cancellation. Otherwise it would be
                disabled as default.



         * - ``spi-full-duplex``
           - ``boolean``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Enable SPI 4wires mode with separated MISO and MOSI lines





   .. group-tab:: Deprecated node specific properties

      Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

      (None)

   .. group-tab:: Base properties

      Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
      common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
      may apply to the "st,lis2mdl" compatible.
