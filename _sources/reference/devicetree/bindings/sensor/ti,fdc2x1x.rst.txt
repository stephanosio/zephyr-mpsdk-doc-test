           - .. code-block:: none

                Auto-Scan Sequence Configuration.
                The FDC will perform a single conversion on each channel
                in the sequence selected, and then restart the sequence continuously.

                The sensor performs conversion on Channel 0 to 1 by default after
                power-on-reset. This setting only applies if autoscan=true
                (multichannel mode).

                0 = Ch0, Ch1
                1 = Ch0, Ch1, Ch2 (FDC2114, FDC2214 only)

         * - ``active-channel``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Selects channel for continuous conversions.

                The sensor performs continuous conversion on Channel 0 by default after
                power-on-reset. This setting only applies if autoscan=false
                (single channel mode).

         * - ``sensor-activate-sel``
           - ``string``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Sensor Activation Mode Selection.

                The sensor uses low-power activation mode by default after
                power-on-reset.

                full-current = the FDC will drive maximum
                sensor current for a shorter sensor activation time.

                low-power = the FDC uses the value programmed by "idrive" during
                sensor activation to minimize power consumption.



             Default value: ``low-power``

             Legal values: ``'full-current'``, ``'low-power'``

         * - ``ref-clk-src``

                external = Reference frequency is provided from CLKIN pin.



             Default value: ``internal``

             Legal values: ``'internal'``, ``'external'``

         * - ``current-drive``
           - ``string``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Select Current Sensor Drive.

                The sensor uses normal current drive by default after power-on-reset.
                High current drive is not supported if autoscan=false and will default
                to normal.

                normal = The FDC will drive all channels with normal sensor current
                (1.5mA max).

                high = The FDC will drive channel 0 with current >1.5mA.



             Default value: ``normal``

             Legal values: ``'normal'``, ``'high'``

         * - ``output-gain``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                1 = Gain = 4   | Effective Resolution 14 bits | 25% full scale
                2 = Gain = 8   | Effective Resolution 15 bits | 12.5% full scale
                3 = Gain = 16  | Effective Resolution 16 bits | 6.25% full scale



             Legal values: ``0``, ``1``, ``2``, ``3``

         * - ``supply-gpios``
           - ``phandle-array``
           - .. code-block:: none

                GPIO specifier that controls power to the device.

                This property should be provided when the device has a dedicated
                switch that controls power to the device.  The supply state is
                entirely the responsibility of the device driver.

                Contrast with vin-supply.



         * - ``vin-supply``
           - ``phandle``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Reference to the regulator that controls power to the device.
                The referenced devicetree node must have a regulator compatible.

                This property should be provided when device power is supplied
                by a shared regulator.  The supply state is dependent on the
                request status of all devices fed by the regulator.

                Contrast with supply-gpios.  If both properties are provided
                then the regulator must be requested before the supply GPIOS is
                set to an active state, and the supply GPIOS must be set to an
                inactive state before releasing the regulator.
