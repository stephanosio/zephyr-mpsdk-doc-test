         * - Name
           - Type
           - Details

         * - ``supply-gpios``
           - ``phandle-array``
           - .. code-block:: none

                GPIO specifier that controls power to the device.

                This property should be provided when the device has a dedicated
                switch that controls power to the device.  The supply state is
                entirely the responsibility of the device driver.

                Contrast with vin-supply.



         * - ``vin-supply``
           - ``phandle``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Reference to the regulator that controls power to the device.
                The referenced devicetree node must have a regulator compatible.

                This property should be provided when device power is supplied
                by a shared regulator.  The supply state is dependent on the
                request status of all devices fed by the regulator.

                Contrast with supply-gpios.  If both properties are provided
                then the regulator must be requested before the supply GPIOS is
                set to an active state, and the supply GPIOS must be set to an
                inactive state before releasing the regulator.





   .. group-tab:: Deprecated node specific properties

      Deprecated properties not inherited from the base binding file.

      (None)

   .. group-tab:: Base properties

      Properties inherited from the base binding file, which defines
      common properties that may be set on many nodes. Not all of these
      may apply to the "sbs,sbs-gauge" compatible.

                When this property is provided a specific flag is set into the
                device that tells the system that the device is capable of
                wake up the system.

                Wake up capable devices are disabled (interruptions will not wake up
                the system) by default but they can be enabled at runtime if necessary.
