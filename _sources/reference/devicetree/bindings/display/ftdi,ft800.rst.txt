      .. list-table::
         :widths: 1 1 4
         :header-rows: 1

         * - Name
           - Type
           - Details

         * - ``irq-gpios``
           - ``phandle-array``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Optional IRQ line of FT800 controller


         * - ``pclk``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                The value to divide the main clock by for PCLK. If the
                typical main clock was 48MHz and this value is 5, the PCLK
                will be 9.6 MHz. Must be positive value to enable the screen



             This property is **required**.

         * - ``pclk_pol``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Polarity of PCLK. If it is set to zero, PCLK polarity is on
                the rising edge. If it is set to one, PCLK polarity is on
                the falling edge.



             This property is **required**.

         * - ``cspread``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Controls the transition of RGB signals with PCLK active clock
                edge. When set to 0, R[7:2],G[7:2] and B[7:2] signals change
                following the active edge of PCLK. When set to 1, R[7:2]
                changes a PCLK clock early and B[7:2] a PCLK clock later,
                which helps reduce the system noise.



             This property is **required**.

         * - ``swizzle``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Controls the arrangement of output RGB pins, which may help
                support different LCD panel. Please check FT800 Programmers
                Guide for details.

             This property is **required**.

             This property is **required**.

         * - ``duplex``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Duplex mode, full or half. By default it's always full duplex thus 0
                as this is, by far, the most common mode.
                Use the macros not the actual enum value, here is the concordance
                list (see dt-bindings/spi/spi.h)
                  0    SPI_FULL_DUPLEX
                  2048 SPI_HALF_DUPLEX



             Legal values: ``0``, ``2048``

         * - ``frame-format``
           - ``int``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Motorola or TI frame format. By default it's always Motorola's,
                thus 0 as this is, by far, the most common format.
                Use the macros not the actual enum value, here is the concordance
                list (see dt-bindings/spi/spi.h)
                  0     SPI_FRAME_FORMAT_MOTOROLA
                  32768 SPI_FRAME_FORMAT_TI



             Legal values: ``0``, ``32768``

         * - ``supply-gpios``
           - ``phandle-array``
           - .. code-block:: none

                GPIO specifier that controls power to the device.

                This property should be provided when the device has a dedicated
                switch that controls power to the device.  The supply state is
                entirely the responsibility of the device driver.

                Contrast with vin-supply.



         * - ``vin-supply``
           - ``phandle``
           - .. code-block:: none

                Reference to the regulator that controls power to the device.
                The referenced devicetree node must have a regulator compatible.

                This property should be provided when device power is supplied
                by a shared regulator.  The supply state is dependent on the
                request status of all devices fed by the regulator.

                Contrast with supply-gpios.  If both properties are provided
                then the regulator must be requested before the supply GPIOS is
                set to an active state, and the supply GPIOS must be set to an
                inactive state before releasing the regulator.
