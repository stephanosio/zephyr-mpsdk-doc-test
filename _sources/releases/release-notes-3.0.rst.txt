API Changes
***********

Changes in this release
=======================

* Following functions in UART Asynchronous API are using microseconds to represent
  timeout instead of milliseconds:
  * :c:func:`uart_tx`
  * :c:func:`uart_rx_enable`

* Replaced custom LwM2M :c:struct:`float32_value` type with a native double type.

* Added function for getting status of USB device remote wakeup feature.

* Added ``ranges`` and ``dma-ranges`` as invalid property to be used with DT_PROP_LEN()
  along ``reg`` and ``interrupts``.

* The existing :c:func:`crc16` and :c:func:`crc16_ansi` functions have been
  modified. The former has a new signature. The latter now properly calculates the
  CRC-16-ANSI checksum. A new function, :c:func:`crc16_reflect`, has been
  introduced to calculated reflected CRCs.

* GATT callbacks ``bt_gatt_..._func_t`` would previously be called with argument
  ``conn = NULL`` in the event of a disconnect. This was not documented as part
  of the API. This behavior is changed so the ``conn`` argument is provided as
  normal when a disconnect occurs.

Removed APIs in this release
============================

* The following Kconfig options related to radio front-end modules (FEMs) were
  removed:

  * ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_GPIO_PA``
  * ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_GPIO_PA_PIN``
  * ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_GPIO_PA_POL_INV``
  * ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_GPIO_PA_OFFSET``
  * ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_GPIO_LNA``
  * ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_GPIO_LNA_PIN``
  * ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_GPIO_LNA_POL_INV``
  * ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_GPIO_LNA_OFFSET``
  * ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_FEM_NRF21540``
  * ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_GPIO_PDN_PIN``
  * ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_GPIO_PDN_POL_INV``
  * ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_GPIO_CSN_PIN``
  * ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_GPIO_CSN_POL_INV``
  * ``CONFIG_BT_CTLR_GPIO_PDN_CSN_OFFSET``

  This FEM configuration is hardware description, and was therefore moved to
  :ref:`devicetree <dt-guide>`. See the :dtcompatible:`nordic,nrf-radio`
  devicetree binding's ``fem`` property for information on what to do instead
  on the Nordic open source controller.

* Removed Kconfig option ``CONFIG_USB_UART_CONSOLE``.
  Option ``CONFIG_USB_UART_CONSOLE`` was only relevant for console driver
  when CDC ACM UART is used as backend. Since the behavior of the CDC ACM UART
  is changed so that it more closely mimics the real UART controller,
  option is no longer necessary.

* Removed Kconfig option ``CONFIG_OPENOCD_SUPPORT`` in favor of
  ``CONFIG_DEBUG_THREAD_INFO``.

* Removed ``flash_write_protection_set()`` along with the flash write protection
  implementation handler.

* Removed ``CAN_BUS_UNKNOWN`` and changed the signature of
  :c:func:`can_get_state` to return an error code instead.

* Removed ``DT_CHOSEN_ZEPHYR_CANBUS_LABEL`` in favor of utilizing
  :c:macro:`DEVICE_DT_GET`.

* Removed ``CONFIG_LOG_MINIMAL``. Use ``CONFIG_LOG_MODE_MINIMAL`` instead.

Deprecated in this release
==========================

* Removed ``<power/reboot.h>`` and ``<power/power.h>`` deprecated headers.
  ``<sys/reboot.h>`` and ``<pm/pm.h>`` should be used instead.
* :c:macro:`USBD_CFG_DATA_DEFINE` is deprecated in favor of utilizing
  :c:macro:`USBD_DEFINE_CFG_DATA`
* :c:macro:`SYS_DEVICE_DEFINE` is deprecated in favor of utilizing
  :c:macro:`SYS_INIT`.

  :c:macro:`CAN_TX_ARB_LOST`, :c:macro:`CAN_TX_BUS_OFF`,
  :c:macro:`CAN_TX_UNKNOWN`, :c:macro:`CAN_TX_EINVAL`,
  :c:macro:`CAN_NO_FREE_FILTER`, and :c:macro:`CAN_TIMEOUT`) are deprecated in
  favor of utilizing standard errno error codes.
* :c:func:`can_configure` is deprecated in favor of utilizing
  :c:func:`can_set_bitrate` and :c:func:`can_set_mode`.
* :c:func:`can_attach_workq` is deprecated in favor of utilizing
  :c:func:`can_add_rx_filter_msgq` and :c:func:`k_work_poll_submit`.
* :c:func:`can_attach_isr` is is deprecated and replaced by
  :c:func:`can_add_rx_filter`.
* :c:macro:`CAN_DEFINE_MSGQ` is deprecated and replaced by
  :c:macro:`CAN_MSGQ_DEFINE`.
* :c:func:`can_attach_msgq` is deprecated and replaced by
  :c:func:`can_add_rx_filter_msgq`.
* :c:func:`can_detach` is deprecated and replaced by
  :c:func:`can_remove_rx_filter`.

Build and Infrastructure
************************

* Build system

  * New CMake extension functions:

    * ``dt_alias()``
    * ``target_sources_if_dt_node()``

  * The following CMake extension functions now handle devicetree aliases:

    * ``dt_node_exists()``

    Instead, use :dtcompatible:`ti,ina230` or :dtcompatible:`ti,ina237`.

* West (extensions)

  * Added support for gd32isp runner


Libraries / Subsystems
**********************

* Disk


* Management

  * Fixed the mcumgr SMP protocol over serial not adding the length of the CRC16 to packet length.
  * Kconfig option OS_MGMT_TASKSTAT is now disabled by default.

* CMSIS subsystem


* Power management

  * Power management resources are now manually allocated by devices using
    :c:macro:`PM_DEVICE_DEFINE`, :c:macro:`PM_DEVICE_DT_DEFINE` or
    :c:macro:`PM_DEVICE_DT_INST_DEFINE`. Device instantiation macros take now
    a reference to the allocated resources. The reference can be obtained using
    :c:macro:`PM_DEVICE_GET`, :c:macro:`PM_DEVICE_DT_GET` or
    :c:macro:`PM_DEVICE_DT_INST_GET`. Thanks to this change, devices not
    implementing support for device power management will not use unnecessary
    memory.
  * Device runtime power management API error handling has been simplified.
  * :c:func:`pm_device_runtime_enable` suspends the target device if not already
    suspended. This change makes sure device state is always kept in a
    consistent state.
  * Improved PM states Devicetree macros naming
  * Added a new API call :c:func:`pm_state_cpu_get_all` to obtain information
    about CPU power states.
  * ``pm/device.h`` is no longer included by ``device.h``, since the device API
    no longer depends on the PM API.
  * Added support for power domains. Power domains are implemented as
    simple devices and use the existent PM API for resume and suspend, devices
    under a power domain are notified when it becomes active or suspended.
  * Added a new action :c:enum:`PM_DEVICE_ACTION_TURN_ON`. This action
    is used by power domains to notify devices when it becomes active.
  * Added new API (:c:func:`pm_device_state_lock`,
    :c:func:`pm_device_state_unlock` and
    :c:func:`pm_device_state_is_locked`) to lock a device pm
    state. When the device has its state locked, the kernel will no
    longer suspend and resume devices when the system goes to sleep
    and device runtime power management operations will fail.
  * :c:func:`pm_device_state_set` is deprecated in favor of utilizing
    :c:func:`pm_device_action_run`.
  * Proper multicore support. Devices are suspended only when the last
    active CPU. A cpu parameter was added to Policy and SoC interfaces.

* Logging


* Shell


* Storage


* Task Watchdog


* Tracing

  * Support all syscalls being traced using the python syscall generator to
    introduce a tracing hook call.
